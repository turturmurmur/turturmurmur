- 👋 Hi, I’m Murat aka @turturmurmur, breaking stuff has been my passion, glad to make a living and build my life around it
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly testing(aka breaking stuff 😃) and light development, sometimes making games for kids
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the intracacies of javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on javascript, typescript, java, cypress, react, nextjs, nestjs, expressjs, selenium. However, while doing this I am picky on what gets published as public. I keep most of my resources private and err on the side of privacy.
- 📫 How to reach me TBD
